>  Optimality criterion = likelihood
>    All characters have equal weight
>    Likelihood settings:
>                  DNA substitution types = 2 (HKY85 variant)
>                             Ti/tv ratio = 2.42768
>                       State frequencies = empirical: A=0.186528 C=0.30355 G=0.276136 T=0.233786
>          Proportion of invariable sites = none
>                 Rates at variable sites = gamma, shape=0.681261 (4 categories [mean])
>                    Model correspondence = HKY85+G

>      Number of distinct data patterns under this model = 556
>      Molecular clock not enforced
>      Starting branch lengths obtained using Rogers-Swofford approximation method
>      Trees with approximate log likelihoods 5% or further from the target score are rejected without additional iteration
>      Branch-length optimization = one-dimensional Newton-Raphson with pass limit=20, tolerance=1e-07
>      Likelihood calculations performed in single precision
>      Vector processing enabled
>      Using standard Felsenstein pruning for computing likelihoods
>      Conditional-likelihood rescaling threshold = 1e-20

>  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
>    Addition sequence: random
>    Number of replicates = 100
>    Starting seed = generated automatically
>    Number of trees held at each step = 1
>  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) with reconnection limit = 8
>    Steepest descent option not in effect
>  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 100
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if branch length is less than or equal to 1e-08
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  No topological constraints in effect
>  Trees are unrooted

>Heuristic search completed
>  Total number of rearrangements tried = 8479
>  Score of best tree(s) found = 10978.23
